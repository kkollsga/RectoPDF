## Crate graph

A crate may depend only on crates below it in this list. `recto-platform` sits under everything and is the only crate that names an OS.

| Crate | Status | Contract | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| `recto-platform` | **Started** | File identity, process footprint, handle count, `isolate`: child process, channel with handles, shared memory, loaded library. Later `surface`, `fswatch` | Hold policy |
| `recto-core` | **Started** | Lazy document structure over the lopdf fork's `IndexedReader`: facts, page count, contents. Later the append writer | Know about tiles, threads or an OS |
| `recto-proto` | **Started** | Job and tile wire types, no dependencies. The host validates everything from the renderer | |
| `recto-render` | **Started** | `render_tile(page, rect, scale, &mut [u8], cancel)` behind `RenderBackend`, page text. PDFium, by raw FFI | Allocate surfaces, name an OS, decide policy |
| `recto-render-service` | **Started** | Library: the host's side, `DocRenderer`, limits, validation. Binary: the worker. Plain child process for now; sandbox is a separate spike | Link PDFium into the host |
| `recto-index` | **Started** | Text normaliser and hidden-text report: pure functions on the host's side. Later the page-text corpus | Touch the UI |
| `recto-svg` | Planned | Streaming SVG writer | Build a document in memory |
| `recto-sign` | **Started (placeholder)** | Final seams for PAdES creation and the honest report; `PlaceholderSigner` always refuses | Depend on `recto-render`; produce anything that looks like a signature |
| `recto-session` | **Started** | Tabs, tiers, sidebar and view models: all the rules | Name a UI toolkit |
| `recto-agent` | **Started** | Typed, versioned commands, permission levels, the JSON envelope | Hold state of its own |
| `recto-ffi` | Planned | UniFFI, pinned to what the C# generator supports (0.31 in Seedwell); every call async or bounded | Hold rules |
| `recto-cli` | **Started** | `recto`: thin client of `recto-agent`, with a headless session for tests | Link AppKit |
| `app/` | Planned | AppKit host, QA channel | Hold rules |

## Quality bar

- `unsafe` is forbidden in every crate except the OS seams (`recto-platform`, `recto-ffi`) and the PDFium seam (`recto-render/src/pdfium.rs`). Every `unsafe` has a SAFETY comment.
- Clippy with `-D warnings`.
- No panics on untrusted input. Collections grown from outside input have a cap.
- A struct held per item documents its size and asserts it in a test.
- Dependencies count: `default-features = false`, few crates, and a line below saying why each one is here.

## Per-item sizes

| Struct | Held per | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| `TabRecord` | Every tab, including cold | ≤ 256 B plus title |
| `TocEntry` | Contents item, warm tab only | ≤ 32 B |
| `TileKey` | Tile in the cache | ≤ 16 B |
| `RenderJob`, `TileReply` | Job in a capped queue, reply in flight | ≤ 64 B |
| `CharRecord` | Character of a page in hand | 4 B |

## Dependencies

| Crate | Why |
|---|---|
| `lopdf` (fork) | The lazy `IndexedReader`, and later the append writer. Pinned to a git revision |
| `serde`, `serde_json` | The agent JSON envelope |
| `libc` | `proc_pid_rusage` for footprint, and process, channel and shared-memory calls, `recto-platform` only |
| `flate2` | Compresses `render`'s PNG. Already in the tree through lopdf, so it adds no crate. `recto-agent` only |
| PDFium (not a crate) | Draws pages. `bblanchon/pdfium-binaries` release `chromium/8125`, PDFium 158.0.8125.0, no V8, no XFA. Loaded at run time, by the worker alone. `tools/pdfium.sh` fetches it from that release's URL to `target/pdfium/` and stops unless the tarball is SHA-256 `4939bd93…139d` and the library `a45c4464…373a`; `--attest` also runs `gh attestation verify`. It links AppKit; see the sandbox note below |

**No `pdfium-render`.** The spike used it only for raw bindings, because its high-level loaders can't take a `pread` callback and `PdfDocument::handle()` is crate-private. 27 signatures in one file cost no crate; `pdfium-render` costs 24 in the tree. The worker is 0.48 MB here against the spike's 1.3 MB, which also carried JSON.

## Renderer

**The process.** One worker per document, in a plain child process on a socket pair, with shared memory for pixels and one shared word for cancelling. It inherits nothing but its channel (`POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT`) and an empty environment, gets the document as a descriptor, and never learns a path. No thread in the host: the call blocks its caller, which is never the UI thread, and watches while a job is in flight. A cold tab has no `DocRenderer`, so it pays for none of this.

**Limits**, all held from outside the worker, because it may be compromised:

| What | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Hard memory limit | 512 MiB footprint, read every 5 ms during a job, then the sequence below | The worst real page reaches 493 MiB. macOS has no OS limit for this: `setrlimit` refuses `RLIMIT_AS`, `RLIMIT_DATA` and `RLIMIT_RSS` with `EINVAL` |
| Page deadline, with kill | 5 s | Platform §2.6. The slowest real page at 2x took 939 ms |
| Retirement | 64 MiB after a job; the worker goes before its next job for another page | Only exit returns PDFium's memory (spike §6). Tiles of one page share a worker: retiring between them cost 72 respawns and 14 s on the USGS map |
| Cancel by generation | Kill 90 ms after a job goes stale, if it hasn't returned | A stale render is gone within 100 ms, by return or kill. PDFium's pause callback runs only between objects |
| Idle exit | 30 s after the last job | |

**The memory sequence** (owner, 2026-11-06), all decided in `DocRenderer`, with only the reading of free memory in `recto-platform`:

1. **512 MiB.** A worker with history gets one more try in a fresh one, because what stopped it may be what earlier pages left behind.
2. **That page alone at up to 1 GiB,** if `kern.memorystatus_level` is at least 30 and no other page has the one heavy slot. 30% is about 4.8 GiB free on 16 GB, and 2.4 GiB on 8 GB, over twice what the retry can use. The slot is per process and goes with the worker, so the worst case stays near 1 GiB. A viewer takes it without waiting. The heavy worker goes before any other page.
3. **On screen only: a lower-resolution version at a quarter of the scale,** under the normal limit, reported in `Tile::low_res` with its scale, rectangle and reason. A page lacking only memory or the slot may go sharp later (`may_clear`); one past 1 GiB won't.
4. **`PageFailed`,** with words saying even that couldn't be drawn. Remembered with every step before it, so a hostile page runs each step once and then costs nothing. `forget_failures` clears it. `page_draw_state` gives this to a view model.

**Exports differ** (owner, 2026-11-07). Whole-page drawing (`recto render`, later print and snapshot) goes in strips under the same limits, with `DrawPurpose::Export`. Step 3 doesn't apply: an export is sharp or isn't written. If it needs the larger limit it sleeps for the slot, up to `export_slot_wait` (60 s), ahead of any viewer, and a cancel ends the wait at once. No memory free, the wait running out, or the page passing 1 GiB each refuse plainly with nothing written: `export_memory_tight`, `export_wait_timed_out` (exit 7), `export_page_too_heavy`. It can block for a long time, so it's a call for a job thread, never a UI thread. On-screen tiles still never wait. The slot's ticket lives in the heavy process's end action, so it frees when the process has really gone, however it went, with nobody needing to touch its document. An idle heavy worker can still hold it for up to 35 s. A worker the host doesn't watch would be free to grow, so during a job the worker also runs a small thread of its own that checks its footprint, its deadline and whether the host is still there. That thread starts with the first job and parks between jobs.

**Between jobs and at exit.** One reaper thread in the host, alive only while a worker is, sleeps in `kevent`. It collects a worker the moment it ends, and at most once per `idle_exit + idle_grace` (35 s) per live worker it checks the idle rule: past its time or its memory limit, the worker is killed. That's one wake-up per 35 s per live worker, none with no worker, and no thread or handle left behind. A compromised worker could still grow unseen between those wake-ups: closing that needs the sandbox's memory limit. Killing never blocks: a process stuck in a read from a dead network volume can't die until the read returns, so the host signals it and moves on, and the reaper collects it whenever that happens. This wasn't tested against a real dead volume; the property tested is that nothing waits.

**Measured** 2026-11-06, release build, this Mac, warm cache, against the spike. Per-page figures are medians of 3 runs over the same 5,689 pages of bench100, at 2x, whole pages, no retirement, as in the spike. `recto budget render --file F --count 200 --samples --retire-mib 4000 --limit-mib 4096`.

| | Spike | Now |
|---|---:|---:|
| Idle worker footprint, 423 spawns | 2.27 MiB | 2.27 MiB |
| Worker binary | 1.3 MB | 0.48 MB |
| Text and vector pages, p50 / p95, as the host sees it, round trip | 2.06 / 8.64 ms, in process | 2.57 / 8.31 ms |
| All pages, p50 / p95 | 2.41 / 30.39 ms | 2.98 / 28.33 ms |
| Respawn, reopen, draw first page, `rfc9110` | 13.28 ms | 12.95 ms |
| `gov_nasa_ntrs20240002628`, peak with retirement at 64 MiB | 115.8 MiB | 83.2 MiB |
| Largest peak across files, p95, with retirement | | 153 MiB (257 without) |
| `form_bomb`, every step of the memory sequence | 4 GiB, killed by the harness in 6.3 s | 3.1 s in all, peak 1 GiB, then nothing: it's remembered |

The 0.4 ms at p50 is classifying a whole page's pixels (659 µs on a full grey page). The app draws tiles, at 92 µs a tile, so this is mostly a cost of whole-page runs. With retirement on, p95 rises to 10.04 ms from the respawns it causes.

**Regions.** When several tiles of a page are needed, one PDFium pass can draw them all, and the tiles are handed out of its surface, each classified by itself. Sampling the USGS map showed why it matters: its two 5104 x 6004 images aren't kept between passes, so each pass inflates the image's Flate stream again from the top, up to the rows it needs (over 80% of the time). That cost is per pass, not per pixel, so a pass per tile pays it again and again. `recto budget render --viewport 3024x1964` measures what a reader does, in the median of 5 runs, peak being the worker's:

| Page, 2x | Step | Tiles | ms per tile | ms now | Passes | Peak MiB before | Peak MiB now |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| USGS map | First view | 35 | 2,136 | 534 | 2 | 332 | 394 |
| | Scroll, a quarter window | 7 | 825 | 101 | 1 | 342 | 394 |
| | Zoom, 1.5x | 49 | 2,711 | 379 | 2 | 342 | 452 |
| NASA, images (`ntrs20240002628` p50) | First view / scroll / zoom | 18 / 3 / 28 | 66 / 9 / 43 | 68 / 9 / 43 | per tile | 64 | 64 |
| NASA, shaded backgrounds (`ntrs20220005969` p175) | First view / scroll / zoom | 18 / 3 / 28 | 513 / 4 / 689 | 514 / 4 / 689 | per tile | 176 | 173 |
| `rfc9110` p10 | First view / scroll / zoom | 18 / 3 / 28 | 17 / 0.8 / 9.8 | 17 / 0.8 / 9.6 | per tile | 8 | 8 |

Only pages with an image of 20 Mpx or more use regions: `REGION_MIN_IMAGE_PIXELS`, with its table, gives why. Below that a region costs more memory, and between 1 and 20 Mpx more time as well. 20 Mpx rests on 4 sampled pages from 2 documents above it and 17 pages just under. The owner accepted the USGS map's peak of about 415–450 MiB under the named exception to the 170 MiB budget (2026-11-07). A region is capped at 32 MiB (`MAX_REGION_BYTES`), which covers a 3024 x 1964 window and a third more, and takes more passes beyond that. It's mapped in the worker while drawing, so the memory limit and its sequence see it, and it goes down the same sequence as a tile, with the same cancelling and validation.

**What the limit does to the 28 pages above 170 MiB**, each exported whole at 2x in a fresh worker, with no heavy step: at 512 MiB all 28 draw, and the worst peaks at 396 MiB, down from 488 now that whole pages go in pieces. At 256 MiB, 17 are refused, and at 170 MiB, all 28. A kill overshoots by up to about 55 MiB on a large image's single allocation.

**The USGS map, before and after.** Whole page as tiles at 2x went from 3.75 s to 0.70 s, peak 339 to 426 MiB, and at 4x from 10.9 s to 2.95 s, peak 342 to 448 MiB. `recto render` at 2x is 0.83 s; at 4x it was stopped at the limit and is now 2.46 s, peak 468 MiB.

**The first pass's 450 ms** is about half inflating the two images' Flate streams and most of the rest stretching them (sampled at 0.25x). It's the same at any zoom, because every source row must be inflated. Nothing short of a change to PDFium or a preview cached from an earlier run avoids it.

**The renderer is hostile.** Replies go through `recto-proto`'s decoders and validators before anything uses them; any violation kills the worker. A frame's claimed length costs nothing until bytes arrive. Pixels are copied out of shared memory, never referenced in place, and shared memory can't be resized once sized on macOS, so a worker can't make the host fault. A compromised worker can still draw a wrong picture and rewrite a surface it was given earlier; that's the limit of this design until surfaces are per-job IOSurfaces.

**Sandbox: not in place yet.** The worker has `RLIMIT_CORE`, `RLIMIT_FSIZE` and `RLIMIT_NPROC` at zero and nothing else, so a compromised worker can read what the user can. The XPC sandbox is a separate spike, whose known problem is that `libpdfium.dylib` links AppKit. Everything crosses as frames and handles so XPC can replace the transport: the worker takes no path to a document, and argv names only limits and the library.

**Search text.** `recto-index::normalize` turns PDFium's characters into text `rg` can search. Its rules and their limits are in that crate's header. In short: at a line-end hyphen it follows the rest of the page if the page shows a form, keeps the hyphen for capitals, one- or two-letter tails and a short closed list of compound words, and otherwise joins. It's a guess, so the other spelling of each decision goes in `also_spelled`. Lines stay lines. On bench100 it joined 12,297 and kept 1,627, with no `simulationbased` or `datadriven` left, and line hits equal to the spike's normaliser on every common word checked but one (`office`, 633 against 634), plus 4 more for `simulation-based`.

**Hidden text.** The spike's prototype: draw the page at 2x, mark a character with no ink under its box (range under 16, box padded by 2 px). `hidden_text.flagged` means a run of 3 or more such characters; shorter ones are thin glyphs, and stay in the count. On bench100 that flags 126 of 5,689 pages, and 19,732 of 16.4 M characters have no ink; neither has been reviewed for false positives. It's a flag: every character stays in the text, under `untrusted`. Its limits: hidden text next to visible text passes, because the box has ink. An OCR layer over a scan is expected to pass, but this corpus has no scan to prove it on. Annotation text the page draws isn't in page text at all (spike §10.4). If the extra render stops the worker, the text comes back with `checked: false`, which never reads as clean.

**Fetching PDFium.** Run `tools/pdfium.sh`, which `tools/check.sh` also runs. The worker finds the library beside itself or in `../pdfium/`. The worker binary is `recto-render-service`, found beside `recto`. `RECTO_PDFIUM_LIB` and `RECTO_RENDER_SERVICE` override, in debug builds only: nothing shipped loads code from a path in its environment. The digest is checked when the script fetches, not at each load; code signing covers that in the app. `cargo build -p recto-cli` alone doesn't build it: use `--workspace`.

## Machine notes

Lints and profiles are set once in the root `Cargo.toml`. `tools/check.sh` is the one local check, and takes the shared heavy-job lock.
